-- /usr/local/share/config:

    Software is configured globally to permit easy creation of new users.
    This directory stores configuration files for software that only accepts 
    local configuration. The files inside this directory can then be 
    symbolically linked into users' home directories.

    Some configuration files, such as `gdbinit`, are copied by value through
    /etc/skel.


-- /usr/local/share/theme:

    Permitted colours, background images, etc.


-- /usr/local/share/doc/$HOSTNAME:

    Documentation for this specific machine. Should be symbolically linked to 
    $HOME/.$HOSTNAME.
